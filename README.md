# 🔁 Recursion

**Subject**: Algorithms and Data Structures  
**Name**: Ayazbek Abdanur

## 📌 Project Description

This project is a collection of classic recursive algorithms implemented in Java as part of the **ADS Assignment 1**. Each method showcases how recursion can solve common problems such as factorial calculation, checking for primes, string permutations, and computing the GCD. The purpose of the project is to deepen understanding of recursive thinking and its application in solving real-world algorithmic challenges.

## 💡 Features

- ✅ Find minimum element in an array using recursion  
- ✅ Calculate average of array elements  
- ✅ Check if a number is prime recursively  
- ✅ Compute factorial of a number  
- ✅ Generate Fibonacci numbers  
- ✅ Raise a number to a power (a^n)  
- ✅ Generate all permutations of a string  
- ✅ Validate if a string contains only digits  
- ✅ Compute binomial coefficients (n choose k)  
- ✅ Find greatest common divisor (GCD) recursively  
- ✅ Time & Space complexity comments for each problem  

## 📦 Technologies

- 💻 Java  
- 📐 Recursion  
- 📊 Algorithm Design & Time Complexity  
- 🔣 String and Array Manipulation  

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MnstrsParago/ADS.ASG1.Recursion.git
   cd ADS.ASG1.Recursion
   ```

2. **Open the project** in your favorite IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code).

3. **Run `Main.java`**:

   * The `main` method already includes tests for all implemented problems.
   * Simply execute the file and check the console output.

## 📘 Reflection

This assignment helped solidify my understanding of recursion, its use cases, and its performance limitations. While some functions like Fibonacci and Binomial Coefficient reveal the inefficiencies of naive recursion, others demonstrate elegant and efficient solutions. Adding time and space complexity for each function improved my ability to analyze recursive depth and call stack usage. Overall, it was a valuable exercise in both theory and practical coding.
